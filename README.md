# KubernetesPodConfigTemplate

K8 is a container orchestration framework designed to deploy, scale and maintain containerized applications. 
It uses definition files for creation, scaling and load balancing application containers. Kubernetes uses master slave architecture, 
where master node schedules PODS on other nodes. PODS can contain one instance of one type of container. 


The Definition file is broken into -

apiVersion
kind
metadata
spec
status


kind type - deployment, service, pods, replication 

Kuberentes provide declarative and imperative style of kube control.
